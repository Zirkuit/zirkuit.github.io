            Zirkuit is developing small and large projects using software and hardware combined to find solutions to
            modern-day problems. Do you love working on challenges that no one has solved yet? Do you like
            innovating?<br><br>

            As a member of our group, you will have the unique opportunity to shape our future with solutions to many
            common issues people are facing. At Zirkuit's Robotics team, you will have the chance to work with the
            brightest minds on a magnificent robotics project that aims to change the near future.<br><br>

            <b>About the role</b><br>
            You will architect, design, and work with Zirkuit's robotics team on a robotics project aiming to improve
            human lives with their basic and advanced functions that include Artificial Intelligence and Machine
            Learning capabilities. You will be responsible for generating solutions and ideas to common problems
            occurred
            in the project progress while working with the rest of the team.<br><br>

            <b>About you</b><br>
            - You find large challenges exciting and enjoy discovering and defining problems as much as solving
            them.<br>
            - You deliver. You may enjoy thoughtful conversations about problems and perfecting designs, but in the end,
            you know that what matters is delivering a manufacturable solution that works every time.<br>
            - You are a cross-disciplinary team member. You are excited to work with and learn from software,
            hardware, electrical and graphical designers. You are comfortable communicating across teams.<br><br>

            <b>Key & Preffered Qualifications</b><br>
            - You have working experience architecting, designing and selecting robotic systems.<br>
            - You have working experience with mechanical fixturing, design and production.<br>
            - Basic Knowledge of GD&T techniques and ability to read mechanical drawings<br>
            - Proficiency with CAD including Solidworks, Pro/Engineer, or NX<br>
            - Robotic mechanical and electrical trouble shooting skills<br>
            - Proficiency in programming languages C, C++, Python, etc.<br>
            - Excellent communication skills, both written & verbal.<br>
            - Self driven and able to execute with limited supervision.<br><br>

            <b>Education & Experience</b><br>
            No education degree is required for any Zirkuit positions.<br><br>

            <b>What we offer</b><br>
            - An opportunity to change the world and work with some of the smartest and the most talented experts from
            different fields.<br>
            - Growth potential. We rapidly advance team members who have an outsized impact.<br><br>

            <b>Disclaimers</b><br>
            The above requirements are non-obligatory and will accept any exceptions. Our goal is to
            gather people who have average or close knowledge in these areas and create a working environment
            together.<br><br>
            
            This is an initially volunteer job. Revenue will start after first prototypes and production
            of projects.<br><br>
