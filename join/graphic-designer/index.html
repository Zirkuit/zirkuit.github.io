            Zirkuit is developing small and large projects using software and hardware combined to find solutions to
            modern-day problems. Do you love working on challenges that no one has solved yet? Do you like
            innovating?<br><br>

            As a member of our group, you will have the unique opportunity to shape our future with solutions to many
            common issues people are facing. At Zirkuit's Graphic Design team, you will have the chance to work with
            the
            brightest minds to promote a magnificent robotics project that aims to change the near future.<br><br>

            <b>About the role</b><br>
            You will design, sketch, and prototype various graphic design projects to promote Zirkuit's products,
            Zirkuit itself, and others. You will also work on various branding works to ease
            to-do's.<br><br>

            <b>About you</b><br>
            - You find large challenges exciting and enjoy discovering and defining problems as much as solving
            them.<br>
            - You deliver. You may enjoy thoughtful conversations about problems and perfecting designs, but in the end,
            you know that what matters is delivering a manufacturable solution that works every time.<br>
            - You are a cross-disciplinary team member. You are excited to work with and learn from software,
            hardware, electrical and graphical designers. You are comfortable communicating across teams.<br>
            - Resourceful, flexible, and adaptable; no task is too big or too small.<br><br>

            <b>Key & Preffered Qualifications</b><br>
            - 2+ years experience as a designer<br>
            - Expertise in Figma, Sketch and Adobe suite application expertise.<br><br>

            <b>Education & Experience</b><br>
            No education degree is required for any Zirkuit positions.<br><br>

            <b>What we offer</b><br>
            - An opportunity to change the world and work with some of the smartest and the most talented experts from
            different fields.<br>
            - Growth potential. We rapidly advance team members who have an outsized impact.<br><br>

            <b>Disclaimers</b><br>
            The above requirements are non-obligatory and will accept any exceptions. Our goal is to
            gather people who have average or close knowledge in these areas and create a working environment
            together.<br><br>
            
            This is an initially volunteer job. Revenue will start after first prototypes and production
            of projects.<br><br>

            Zirkuit provides equal opportunity in all of our employment practices to all qualified employees and
            applicants without regard to race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age, disability, marital
